Leverages the Telnyx API/Node SDK to create an AI Assistant that can communicate via SMS. 

Uses OpenAI to reply to received messages via SMS/MMS.

Request images via OpenAI DALL-E 2 (due to file size limitations of MMS). 

Also supports transcriptions and translations to English thanks to the Whisper API. Just send an audio file to assistant and quickly receive transcriptions via SMS.

If an attachment is sent to your assistant, it will be stored in your very own folder using the Digital Ocean Spaces / AWS S3 API.
