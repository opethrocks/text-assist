Leverages the Telnyx API/Node SDK to create an AI Assistant that can communicate via SMS. 

Uses OpenAI Chat Completions with GPT 3.5 Turbo to reply with robust responses to received messages, all via SMS.

Now includes MMS support via OpenAI dall-e 3. Just ask for a photo and your assistant has you covered!

If an attachment is sent to your assistant, it will be stored in your very own folder via Digital Ocean Spaces / AWS S3 API.
